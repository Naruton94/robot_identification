Linear form of robotic dynamics:

tau = K(theta,theta_dot,theta_ddot) * phi;
where tau is torques, phi is dynamic parameters to be identified, K is the matrix with respect to joint angles, angular velocities and accelerations.

There are three important functions:

1) fk.c
It calculates the K matrix according to theta, theta_dot and theta_ddot (i.e. angle, angular velocity and acceleration of joints).

2) idf_SVD_priori.c
It solves the above linear equation by Singular Value Decomposition method (SVD) to find the best dynamic parameters, i.e. phi.

3) Errestim.c
It predicts the torques according to the solved phi and measured K, then compares them with the measured torques to obtain the err between them.

The main.c file is a test example.
